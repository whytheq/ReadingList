# Plot

Intriguing plot of a famous talk-show host who seemingly becomes someone who  
does not exist. It is magnified as his talk show has around thirty million weekly  
viewers and this is all happening within an alternative dystopian World where  
we are all under surveillance and the police have records for us all.
